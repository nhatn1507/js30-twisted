Day 1: 

Lessons:

- learn about data- attribute, js document.querySelector

- better code design, with audio.currentTime, transition & transitionend & transform

- phrase tags such as <kbd>, better understanding of transition, =>, forEach, .addEventListener, and const
  
The twist: to have users to play along some drum beats and they have to fast trying to catch up with "playing" keys, otherwise their scores are deducted each time a key isn't pressed on time. 

As of now, I cannot read the drum notation as well as I need to change the transition duration (of key) based on each of the node length in the beat. So there's a problem between translating a drum-beat sheet into list of (key, transition) pairs, and the time it takes to implement the coding.

I hope to revisit this problem at another time and implement my twist to make it an enjoyable game.
