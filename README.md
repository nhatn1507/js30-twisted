The twist that I want to implement is to have users to play along some drum beats and they have to fast trying to catch up with "playing" keys, otherwise their scores are deducted each time a key isn't pressed on time. 

As of now, I cannot read the drum notation as well as I need to change the transition duration (of key) based on each of the node length in the beat. So there's a problem between translating a drum-beat sheet into list of (key, transition) pairs, and the time it takes to implement the coding.

I hope to revisit this problem at another time and implement my twist to make it an enjoyable game.
